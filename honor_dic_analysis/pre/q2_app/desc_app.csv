7,R_1igmYlmlfpDF2EL,"I don't know if I ever think it's *right* to hold a grudge. I don't think that people need to always forgive, and I don't think they should forget -- but that's not the same as holding a grudge. Holding a grudge is active and it just causes the holder harm."

22,R_3p55ZbAR64824Wq,"If the person against whom you hold the grudge hurt you, either out of ignorance or on purpose and refuses to acknowledge, let alone apologize for, doing so AND holding the grudge might force them to admit their actions, a grudge might be 'right'. Although, I usually find holding a grudge to be somewhat beyond my conscious control."

27,R_3feHjrNarFXsgQN,"It is right to hold a grudge when you've been severely betrayed by someone who you hold a strong relationship with or when the stakes are high. For example, it would be right to hold a grudge against a significant other who cheated on you after being together for a long time."

47,R_1my3cfSp4ZJ8FV2,"If someone did something intentionally, I think it's alright to hold a grudge. For example, I was once in a group project with a girl who did not turn in her part of the assignment with no notice. She then didn't come to class and spoke poorly about the rest of the group to everyone she knew because we ""threw her under the bus"" by telling the professor what had happened. I've had other classes with this girl since then, and I refuse to complete group work with her because of this. She intentionally didn't give us a heads up or come to class because she thought it would excuse her part of the assignment, so I know that this deliberate action means it could happen again in the future."

64,R_28TBaImknWgRRLg,"I don't think it is right to hold a grudge at all. But I also think that you don't have to forget or necessarily forgive either. I think grudges only hurt the person holding one, like poisoning yourself and expecting the other person to get sick. I think it's understandable to hold a grudge where the wrong was truly bad and that there was no resolution, but I think that's the time to try and find the closure within yourself."

115,R_1C8Eza1KY8cwfwE,"i don't really think it is right to hold a grudge. that type of negative energy is not good for a person and will only lead to further resentment of the person, possibly even yourself. we need to look at why the person did what they did and realize that it is okay. in these types of situations the person that committed the act that would cause the average person to hold a grudge comes to me to apologize for how they acted. that is if i don't approach them and ask why they did what they did in the first place."

162,R_2tPEeS4SBorHEGd,"I think it could be right to hold a grudge if it protects you from further pain inflicted by the person the grudge is against.

I think people don't look at what they're getting (or not getting) at holding a grudge, enough. I think it's rarely worthwhile, but also rarely examined, to see what one is getting out of it. There's a difference, I think, between not giving forgiveness for a transgression and holding a grudge. Still, too, people have their own differences of these definitions: it's all subjective. I think holding a grudge, for me personally, is a step beyond not forgiving. In my case, I'd perhaps hold a grudge if I thought malice was involved in another person's actions, and that they -continued to hold malice- and perhaps continued to hold intent to do malice or held malice in their overall intent."
