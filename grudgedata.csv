I think people don't look at what they're getting (or not getting) at holding a grudge, enough. I think it's rarely worthwhile, but also rarely examined, to see what one is getting out of it. There's a difference, I think, between not giving forgiveness for a transgression and holding a grudge. Still, too, people have their own differences of these definitions: it's all subjective. I think holding a grudge, for me personally, is a step beyond not forgiving. In my case, I'd perhaps hold a grudge if I thought malice was involved in another person's actions, and that they -continued to hold malice- and perhaps continued to hold intent to do malice or held malice in their overall intent.","I think it's wrong to hold a grudge (for me, anyway) when someone has made apologies and reparations.
