"6","R_RfYUkPPby1QuujL","I held a grudge when my sister didn't take part in my family's Christmas which is the one time the four of us are together all year. I found it very selfish of her to decide to opt out when myself and my father had traveled specifically to spend time with the family. My parents are getting older and my sister's decision was purely selfish and self serving and I felt she wasn't able to grasp the larger picture of the situation. It was extremely hurtful."
"7","R_1igmYlmlfpDF2EL","Definitely held a grudge against a woman I worked with in high school -- a 50 year old woman who decided that belittling, insulting, and being really mean to a 15 year old was TOTALLY the right thing to do in a workplace. It hurt me a lot and made my job really unpleasant, and I held a grudge for a really long time. I didn't do anything about it, but I think part of that is that I moved out of my hometown (in part to escape people like her)."
"8","R_22PSaYuqrk3SnUn","I held a grudge against a classmate for getting me in trouble despite it being her fault."
"9","R_2dm9vzigtyp6Ah8","I held a grudge against someone who bullied me while growing up, especially because this person initially refused to apologize or recognize that what they were doing was wrong and harmful. I eventually let the grudge go when we talked about it once we were both older and that person apologized for hurting me and had shown actual growth as a person over that time."

We recently had an argument over the storming of the Capitol building on January 6th and I cut communications with him for over a week."
"23","R_3aBjt0PkKUnCbXX","I was bullied in middle school for my speculated sexuality and a girl turned my friend group against me, so I held a grudge against her for years."
"24","R_2CTvPnJUkjATOh0","I have held a grudge against my elder sister for wrongful accusations against me. She claimed that I caused her mental harm years ago, when I was merely a child! I never did this, and I could not believe she would attempt to impute blame on me for such."

"27","R_3feHjrNarFXsgQN","I've held a grudge with a close relative who betrayed and disrespected me in my own household when they were supposed to be helping me on an important court case involving my housing. This was a long time coming and I stood to lose a lot in the case if things went poorly for me. Furthermore, I had came through for said relative in the past when they were in a similar situation and felt like my loyalty was being payed back with nothing."

"32","R_3dZlXlPMBIaALip","My cousin did not like that I had others to confide in and blamed me for a situation that was not my fault. She constantly put me down and would not reach out to me."
"33","R_0AK4bFxTmzm6vpn","My school once screwed up my classes that affected my enrollment status and they refused to fix it which caused significant issues for me. I then dug up the school's own rules and policies and called them out on being in violation of their own rules and policies. When administration still didn't care, I escalated it to the governing body who then took the admins to task."
"34","R_2ZKdEZEH6FKeL2i","As a player on a sports team I encountered many rivalries to players on opposite teams. In one circumstance I was being berated by the crowd of the opposition team because I was playing well against them. They were personally attacking me and saying bad things about me without even knowing me at all. I held a grudge against people from that school and team."

"40","R_3CPdIC3lknJWaQx","There is a person who was a close friend of my partner.  I thought I was also friends with this person, but a couple of years ago they told my partner that they don't like me.  This was a grudge because I realized that the person did not think we were friends, so it was my mistake in the first place, and the comment caused my partner to change their relationship from close friends to polite peers, not really friends anymore.  So in the end, I was not really harmed beyond the initial insult, and did feel empathy for the person (realizing that the reason they didn't like me was based on a false assumption about me), but I still felt insulted and wanted to tell our other friends about the incident in order to cause the person to be ostracized.  I didn't, but I fantasized about it."
"41","R_3je8Hizuxktcxxy","I have held a grudge against my mother for years for not referring to health care professionals when dealing with my mental illness as a child and for also shaming me for who I am."

"46","R_SZvQSRw93jlEf9n","My husband and I had an argument about his religion’s pedophile coverup. At first he tried to lie and say what I discovered were lies. Then he said that things were taken out of context. I recited the policy I had read from their secret elders book. He lied and said there was no such thing. I showed him my copy. He became apoplectic and asked where I had gotten it and how dare I read it. He almost broke a table. He tried to kick me out of the house. He eventually said that the pedophilia was wrong but he trusted that jehovah will fix everything in the end. I asked him why he was angry with me and ready to divorce me for crimes his religion committed. I can’t forgive a person who defends the coverup of pedophilia and considers me a lesser human being than the men who committed those crimes."
"47","R_1my3cfSp4ZJ8FV2","To use a different example, I have held a grudge against an ex-friend who spoke poorly to me about our mutual friends to try and get them to stop hanging out with me. To this day, I'm not really sure why she felt the need to do that, and if she had any problems with me we could've simply talked them out. The fact that she chose to speak poorly about me to people who would tell me about it shows malice on her end, so I haven't really forgiven her for it and our friendship has ended."
"48","R_1LMXzmWMsXxqtks","I don't. I develop ideas on how to ""get even"" if the situation allows but holding a grudge is a waste of brain cycles."

"50","R_10JhWGR6xAOVXqx","The closest I've come to holding a grudge is against one boy in high school who bullied my brother in middle school. I continually resented him even through high school and judged how he acted and what he said harsher than I normally would. He died just a year ago, and now I feel guilty for the grudge I held against his character all those years."
"51","R_1ISeW1IPBCelvJ8","when someone bought something i wanted and they knew it"

"53","R_Zz3Xq0LGcCGkdoJ","When my boyfriend cheat on me."
"54","R_D8zZmoPMMmcxV2p","I've held a grudge after being hurt by a friend because that person did everything that knew would cause me pain and sadness; hence, I held a grudge for some time because I knew that that person could have done things differently if they cared."
"55","R_3hGdLFipphk2ZyT","I don't hold a lot of grudges but there was a guy who was always disruptive in class and I always had to work with him. This has led to my grades dropping and that has led me to hold a grudge for the rest of the year and the next 2 years of highschool."
"56","R_1mEFdgto9fCouzs","When an adult acted unsafely with my younger siblings"
"57","R_20SRWqeKpVpVrBe","My ex-husband emotionally and physically abused me in our marriage. Our divorce and custody battle was terrible. Things have settled now but I will never trust him or give him a chance for anything in my life again."

"59","R_3prPj1j0jg39CXN","When I would carpool someone to school an hour away and the person never returned the favor."
"60","R_1BXIB50FumVmZlS","My last girlfriend and I dated for around two years. We took a break due to Covid (hard to see each other) but stayed in contact. Then, we decided to get back together. Right before we were going to see each other, my girlfriend decided she didn't want to do long distance anymore and started dating someone else instead. Even though she didn't mean to hurt me, it did. I felt this was deserving of a grudge because I had unresolved emotions and felt extremely hurt. I got over it, eventually, and we are okay now. But the grudge was justified because it was a particularly bad action."
"61","R_2DTTFL5Jsu0HREp","Accused of stealing by my brother's roommate. He destroyed some property of mine because of it. I still think he's a bad person"
"62","R_sROopfYQHUyZCEN","honestly, I can't remember any at the moment"
"63","R_blxR6BGQXrRmsBb","There have been several times when I have personally held a grudge. One such instance was a long-standing grudge towards an old schoolmate of mine who treated me poorly in our youth. I’ve never quite managed to forgive them, because of how deeply their words and actions have cut me."
"64","R_28TBaImknWgRRLg","I don't hold grudges, not anymore, I did however when I was younger because I didn't know any better. When I was a kid there were two bullies, one of which had been a friend previously I had thought. They went after me mercilessly for a year and I definitely held a grudge against them both. Over the years the resentment sat there like a wound that wouldn't heal and I didn't like it. I sought out both of the them to try and get some closure, one definitely remembered me and what they'd done but wouldn't talk about it, they were obviously embarrassed and, I like to think, a little ashamed of themselves. The other didn't remember me at all, or much of anything, it seemed she'd had some sort of mental break in high school and was very heavily medicated. All in all afterwards I just felt sorry for them, as an adult I didn't wish for the former to feel bad about it this long afterward and the other I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I came to the understanding that I had been holding onto this baggage for no reason and it had done nothing but make me feel bad and keep the memory of being tortured alive in my mind. Nothing's worth that."
"65","R_DSQLLcgdiu308AF","I've held a grudge when an ex-boyfriend refused to compromise with me on how often we texted/talked. He refused to acknowledge that ignoring me was wrong and instead blamed me for the failures of our relationship."
"66","R_12bBHMytRsflLqi","When my boyfriend hurt my feelings by losing his temper I held a grudge for too long."
"67","R_QggX9yzMdaXsrpD","When I was financially hit hard when I had a business and the employees didn't work hard to help keep the business afloat despite my warnings and I had to pay their wages out of my own dwindling savings. Then when I had to close the business and face financial ruin alone, they told people I was doing better financially than I actually was and had no need to close the business and leave them without jobs and that I was the most terrible boss they ever had."
"68","R_1QLMy4Xa7ut9k78","I have held a grudge against a person I had once thought was a friend but they just told rumors and tried to start problems in my life. This has made me hold a grudge against them."
"69","R_85PpmMP1QB4kMOl","I had a former manager with whom my relationship devolved.  He began to get involved in my personal life and use it as leverage in my professional life.  I decided to leave the position and he made it challenging for me moving forward.  I would say I felt a grudge for a while in that scenario."

"71","R_2wbOHFu2ARR6EH0","When someone has something better than me but i try to avoid those thoughts"
"72","R_3eqPJNTRRm5tEuc","I held a grudge against someone who teased me when I was younger. They were my friend but teased me in front of others. Specifically about the clothes I wore and how often I wore those clothing articles (zip-up sweater). My family was not very well off, so I was insecure about wearing clothes often in school anyway. I held a grudge against this person after they did that the first time."
"73","R_1kTxUOT5oA07mg5","Against those who bullied me in high school."
"74","R_rex68gbNJSdxeLf","When my teammate in soccer injured me by not being careful enough during training. Took away 2 weeks of me playing while I healed."
"75","R_1LUWtLiTfTzocMQ","A person who I considered a friend told me a lot of lies about my then-husband in order to hurt me and my relationship. She's made overtures since then to get forgiveness and I have chosen not to receive those overtures or even respond to her requests for contact."

"83","R_1d5hYfu7SHNtHfx","I’ve held a grudge against a coworker for consistently calling out and leaving everyone else to pick up their slack. Therefore I never asked said coworker to cover my shifts."
"84","R_2XbUSS7HXxo0V7y","I was bullied by a girl in my class as a child and she never apologized even though I gave her hundreds of chances. She lied about me and spread rumors and stole things from me from first grade all the way until seventh grade. It's been over a decade since I've last herd from her but even today I don't think I would forgive her if she tried to contact me."

"90","R_1jAIlPp4Q8cE8nu","I have held grudges against employers that I left and I felt as though i was not treated fairly as I worked out my notice with them, but that has typically been a me problem not a them problem."

"99","R_2s78T5vbUAUS7bJ","An apartment building was being constructed in an area I was interested in. I approached the vendor on an almost weekly basis trying to purchase two adjoining apartments I wanted to merge into one. I wanted to sign a contract and make the downpayment at his discretion. He always told me to rest assured those apartments were “sold to me” but he couldn’t do the paperwork or receive the downpayment due to legal issues that would soon be resolved. On one of my regular visits to the construction site, he informed he had sold one the apartments I wanted, but he had a “better deal” for me with the building rooftop duplex apartment. I was appalled, my expectations were shattered and I hold a grudge against that individual forever."
"100","R_qyoC4rFd0nGeJ7X","I can’t recall a time I’ve held a grudge. Not to say I never have, it’s just been so long I can’t remember. It was probably over something stupid when I was young."

"110","R_1poMmvzq1ah7QIN","Against my brother for assuming I was behind my dads decision to write him out of the will. He never bothered to talk to me about it or get my side of the story. Just flat out took someone elses word and went with that. That hurt."
"111","R_yUgCjtW4T5MMkXT","I still hold a grudge against an old friend. He was talking bad about our other friend behind their back, and I told the other friend what he said. The old friend vehemently denied saying it and attacked me instead of fessing up and admitting he was wrong to do what he did."

"113","R_b1kND646ih9URTr","I have held a grudge against a close family member for something that damaged me a lot in childhood."
"114","R_r9nxMJLKbz7F1ol","I have been trying to think of one this whole time, and the best I've managed is with my sister when I was 15 or so. I told her something in confidence that really frightened me and she went and told the whole family and got them to mock me. The only thing that made me choose this moment is that I learned right then not to trust my sister with important things. She was always doing things like that, but this was the first time it really hurt. After that, there was no 'grudge' so to speak, but I never confided in her again, and I worked really hard to become callused to her words and actions. She has hurt my family in countless horrible ways since, and yet, if she truly needed help, I hope I would be able to be there for her."

"118","R_sLTmFYJeU5lYKop","A significant other repeatedly failed to keep promises, and often backed out on plans last minute without saying anything to me. Each time I would have to actively seek them out for them to tell me that something had come up. I was not upset about the fact that they had emergencies pop up, but I was upset that they didn't think to notify me when they knew I was waiting for them."
"119","R_2s6lkljRBiW4IuO","I haven't held a grudge since I was a young kid. I believe the last time was in middle school when my house was robbed and a fellow classmate was looking like the guy who did it."
"120","R_2xDCIlPiNAMc0fJ","I recently struggled with holding a grudge when a friend of my partner's behaved very badly. It was only indirectly affecting me, but I was extremely frustrated by his behavior and that everyone let him get away with it without letting him know that his behavior was unacceptable.

One of the individuals in my group stepped forward and claimed most of the praise and took credit for much of our work. I was upset because not only was I not recognized, but I felt like I contributed more to the project than that individual. I held a grudge for about a year before just letting it go, but every time I had to work with the individual following that instance, I was angry and hesitant to do well."

"149","R_1HdWr790LTPfuPE","I try not to because it doesn't seem healthy. Also, holding a grudge is tiring! The only thing I can think of is that I do have bottled up annoyance at a sibling though who needles me about a particular event in the past and continues to bring it up in front of my parents even though I've told him in private that it makes me uncomfortable. I used to react more strongly but now it feels like such a waste of my time and emotions to let myself be affected by things that have happened in the past (even as they occur in the ongoing present). Whatever. Water off my back."

I have been angry at her because she told him that he could not spend any time with me during our senior year of college that was very important to me. I have held the grudge despite being his friend because he admitted to me how influential she was in a negative way on his emotional well being because of her controlling who he could see, and this still upsets me to know that someone caused him that pain."

She began going through difficult times with her boyfriend and as a result became a horrible friend and roommate. She broke the lease and moved out early, was rude to myself and my friends, and said mean things about me to other people. She never apologized. I know see her posting things on social media with new friends; however, she seems to go through friends quickly. She also posts about having difficulty making friendships. I especially feel like I hold a grudge when I see these posts."
"184","R_6X7Qt49aLPuDBjX","Oh I have had many, many, many circumstances of holding a grudge. I used to always hold a grudge against my husband when we were first married. We had some major communication issues in the beginning. If he did something that I was hurt by, I would be angry and would hold it over his head. We went to marriage counseling and learned many treasures. Now I have learned to accept mistakes, forgive and let go, and learn for the future. People make mistakes."

I'd say I still hold a lack of forgiveness for an ex who took a lot of money and never paid back even a little and who I know now still takes money from other people. But if I spend time thinking about it, it's not worthwhile: I'll never get that money back, and so it's not worth my time and energy. I'd say it's perhaps more 'poor feelings' I hold, but if it was considered a grudge, I guess that'd be it."

I tried to reach out on several occasions to talk to this person and see what they think ""I did"" to warrant their actions. Over time, I gave up on trying to contact them. Then I had a mutual friend say I should reach out because that person has 'too much pride'. I never reached out as it seemed worthless, and also, why should I be the one to reach out when I have no idea what ""I did""?

She sent me whole paragraph messages about how I went a few weeks without seeing her (I had college classes and was busy). She said if I didn't want to be such a close friend anymore to just let her know and then she'll understand that we could go back to distant friendships. All the while, every time we would spend time together it would have to be ME driving to her house, she would only want to hang out when it was comfortable for her, everything was always on her schedule and preferences. Essentially, our friendship only existed if I made any effort, and if I didn't, then it was nonexistent. Then she had to gall to call me a bad friend and blame everything on me when she couldn't be bothered to put in any effort."

"270","R_27pX5oXzc7UKZnP","My daughter is a kind and caring person and a wonderful friend. She values the friendships she has, emotionally connects with the people she loves, and looks out for them. In grade school, she had a group of friends that she was extremely close with. She did everything for them - including listening to all their problems, keeping their secrets, and looking out for them - like throwing a birthday party for someone who never had one. At some point, the one girl became really popular. This girl had been awkward most of the time in grade school. She was different and no one really wanted to talk to her. My daughter befriended her and because her home life was hard she spent sometimes days and weeks at a time in my house, until she decided that becoming the rebellious, loud teenager that drew attention to herself was the way to go. When this happened she decided that she had outgrown my daughter and viciously cut her out of the friend group The way she went about it was very cruel and was actually a formulated thought out plan. Nothing could have prepared me for the pain my daughter faced. I still hold a grudge against that girl - though my daughter has risen far above that time."
"271","R_1OTUQDJB4vUit2P","I hold grudges when people who aren't very close to me repeat an offensive action multiple times after asking them to change their actions. I don't like when someone strings me along. My time is just as valuable as others yet, constantly, people tell me they'll be here at a certain time. They don't show up on time and only gave me the earlier time as a ruse to get me to wait longer. then, after waiting hours, they change their mind and don't show up at all. Then they want to make plans for the next day to do the same thing to me. If this gets repeated after asking them to be honest with their arrival times, I block their number never to hear from them again. I sometimes wish I could have them as part of my life but, there are lots of people who DO respect my time and not take me for granted. I just have to find other friends."

I wanted him to overcome it so badly, but there were days I would come home from school only to find that he had succumbed to his addiction yet again. I resented him for it every time it happened, but looking back I know that he struggled greatly and was really trying his best."

But when I was I child, I held a grudge against one of my friends for continuing to mock me after I had hurt myself even though I had asked him to stop.

Not only did he fake having cancer to get money and sympathy from his former employer as well as his family, he cost my husband and I a lot of money due to not paying rent for over a year and when we finally were able to evict him, he ruined the house we had rented to him. He continued to lie and manipulate us even through the whole process. He then went to jail for hitting someone continuously with an object and causing substantial damage to their face. He then stole money from his parents, lied consistently to them, and damaged their property. He continues to do this to other people while we have cut him out of our lives for good. He continuously claimed that it wasn't drug related because if it were, we would be more than willing to aid in getting him help. The family is now completely broken and if he ever gets his shit together, it will be a cold day in hell for me to ever forgive and let him back in to my family as too much has happened."

When I heard about his circumstances, I was so angry and I wished that I had married him at the time.  Perhaps, it was partly out of regret, but I wished that the lady would suffer like she made him suffer."

I had a show-down with my niece and her preacher husband about some books I was keeping for their church.  I had tried for months to get some sit down time with them to discuss some problems that I saw.  When that finally happened it wasn't pretty and I was attacked for all of my personal flaws including the fact that I was pretty narcissistic thinking a busy pastor was just supposed to drop everything to meet with me.  The church had approximately 20 members at that time.  I lost my relationship with my niece that day.  I still see that fight when I run into her.  I know that I should be able to let it go but the fact that they ambushed me so that we wouldn't have to deal with the books, which of course was the last I ever saw of them, still really hurts and like I said I have a hard time letting go of anger."

"300","R_333xdzTr1StV4IR","As I mentioned previously, while I've certainly experienced unfairness and unkind behavior from some others, I'm not a grudge-holder. I try to think things through, and acknowledge their wrong actions (or inactions), but in the end I try to move on with my life. I don't want the resentment to drag me down. They did what they did. They will have to live with it, and sometimes, they end up apologizing. But the onus is on them."

As the date she was supposed to visit got closer (for other reasons) I got more and more depressed. I isolated my self from my housemates and friends. She tried to communicate about coming to visit, and I never responded. I didn't want to have to interact with anyone. We haven't talked since, two years.

She has become totally nasty and the last straw was when she said that Nancy Pelosi should kneel and pray over the veteran that died in the Capital Building riot.
