"15","R_27eXObVJmsbgdtY","I always think it is wrong to hold a grudge, albeit, sometimes understandable."
"16","R_1OdpzB1R03kyAzn","When it is beyond the control of the other person. An example could be when someone unintentionally someone in an act where there was no control over the situation."
"17","R_1FQBvw3S4j0jhze","when it was a harmless mistake and there was a valid reason for their actions"

"23","R_3aBjt0PkKUnCbXX","If there is something small and petty that you aren't really affected by, it seems weird to hold a grudge. I think that would just do more damage to you."
"24","R_2CTvPnJUkjATOh0","I believe it is wrong to hold a grudge when an action is performed out of ignorance, such as if a kid were to make an insensitive comment to an adult."
"25","R_30k0oKPO04Rdkmq","Someone taking gum from you"
"26","R_4GfkumHBWRpZyEN","Another person was given a promotion over you, deservedly so. If you are beat fair and square, there's no reason to hold a grudge."
"27","R_3feHjrNarFXsgQN","It is wrong to hold a grudge over minor offenses that don't matter much in the grand scheme of things and/or with people who have little impact on your life. For example, if some random person is rude on the subway, it's not worth the stress of animosity over someone who you'll probably never see again."
"28","R_3JEGXSyDnaKCQay","All of them.  It is useless."
"29","R_1Nh8kHA3OsbxJIe","It is right to hold a grudge if the way they have been wronged is something that affects their short term plans, like taking the last bagel."

"47","R_1my3cfSp4ZJ8FV2","If something is accidental, I don't think you should really hold a grudge against someone. If we go along the same line of thinking with a group project, it wouldn't be okay to hold a grudge is someone had a family emergency that prevented them from completing their part of the project and they were upfront about their circumstances. In that case, they're not trying to do anything wrong, so it's not appropriate to hold a grudge."
"48","R_1LMXzmWMsXxqtks","Always. Live and let live, and if necessary respond. Grudges are a burden on the mind that perverts thinking."
"49","R_1LtElAmws5BjYmd","When the person has not acted with bad intention, for example, the ideology of a person can make him believe that he is doing the right thing, and it is also something that we must understand"

"54","R_D8zZmoPMMmcxV2p","I think it is not okay to hold a grudge when something that happened was not on purpose or was uncontrollable."
"55","R_3hGdLFipphk2ZyT","Holding a grudge against a suitor of your ex-girlfriend. You and your ex are friends and understand why you guys just aren't meant to be together. What is messed up is that you hate her romantic partner or hold a grudge against them when you and your ex agreed that you guys aren't meant to be. To me, that is very petty and is the wrong way to hold a grudge"
"56","R_1mEFdgto9fCouzs","When a person is unable to follow through on a commitment"
"57","R_20SRWqeKpVpVrBe","I think it is wrong to hold a grudge if an honest mistake was made and actions were taken to correct it.

"64","R_28TBaImknWgRRLg","I think it's always wrong to hold a grudge because, again, it only hurts the person who is holding it, not the object of their ire. Though I will say I've seen people purposely avoid closure and acceptance in order to keep holding a grudge and that is definitely wrong. It makes me reflect on the idea that anger can be addictive, and that's scary."
"65","R_DSQLLcgdiu308AF","I believe grudges shouldn't be held until the person that performed the wrongdoing refuses to change their ways. After all, it might have been a misunderstanding, an accident, or an action that the person regrets doing."
"66","R_12bBHMytRsflLqi","When someone made a genuine mistake, i.e. your sister ate your sandwich not knowing it was yours"

"84","R_2XbUSS7HXxo0V7y","I think it is wrong to hold a grudge if its a circumstance in which someone accidentally offended someone and apologized for it or upset/let sonmeone down because of external circumstances that were out of that persons control. For example if Friend A was late to friend B's birthday party because there was a car accident in front of them and they got stuck in traffic and couldn't call then I do not think Friend B should hold a grudge, especially if Friend A apologises for missing the event."

"98","R_2X4czbSW8HQfF0a","when you know that person is truly sorry for what they have done and it was not intentional.  Also if you have chose to forgive someone for their actions, you should not hold a grudge because you made the choice to forgive."

"113","R_b1kND646ih9URTr","If someone cuts you off in traffic."
"114","R_r9nxMJLKbz7F1ol","Holding a grudge is often over really stupid things. Like, 'someone took the last doughnut, even when I had my name on the box.' or reading emotions into a text conversation that was completely misinterpreted. I hear of my friends doing this sometimes and it is just sad how they are so willing to terminate a relationship based on so little."
"115","R_1C8Eza1KY8cwfwE","like i said in my pervious response. i feel it is always wrong to hold a grudge. life is too short to waste time like that. positivity and forgiveness lead to much better feelings for yourself."

I asked someone out on a date a few months ago and after they said yes they canceled at the very last minute and ghosted me. I think it would be wrong to hold a grudge because I don't know what the other person is going through emotionally and personally and I don't want to just write them off as a bad person.

Your friend isn't good at keeping in contact with you because they tend to have depressive episodes and just sometimes fall off the face of the planet.

"374","R_eFGIu2MzWaLkCZ3","When you haven't attempted to correct what was wrong between you and the person/people."
"375","R_2uKAsYtQicBA84V","It is wrong to hold a grudge when there are legitimate, alternative ways of assessing some perceived injustice or wrong. In other words, if there was even the possibility that one's anger was due to a misunderstanding, then a grudge should not be held unless there has been a sincere effort to mend the breach between the two parties."
"376","R_1Lul3hSB1RE2RGr","I think its wrong to hold a grudge when the other party truly thinks what they did wasn't wrong, but they apologize for it anyways."

"380","R_3HCbSkj29cQpsmP","If you are holding a grudge simply of jealousy, it may be worthwhile to rethink whether it's appropriate to do so or not."
"381","R_8kvHiJlty52pRAJ","when you have been hurt and it was an accident, an unintentional event. bascially the opposite of the situation described earlier where a grudge was justified"
"382","R_2TRVKxlSNNISOkk","I think it's wrong to hold one for very long. It just upsets you and is bad for your mental health."
"383","R_3qvwUMlBuQbub6t","Over small things that maybe the other person didn't know they were doing or had no control over."
"384","R_3nJHWBr3ITzf9Pn","I think it would be wrong to hold a grudge if someone did something little to bother someone else when they had no idea that what they were doing was disliked by the other person."

"388","R_3M9ksfMZ1BcAflS","I think when someone does something that they are truly sorry for that doesn't include murder then it is fair to not hold a grudge. It's also healthy. You shouldn't hold a grudge when someone is truly sorry and has repented."
"389","R_3DhIXvK2EPWIPvy","If someone does something for you hoping that it will help, but it ends up harming you. If they sincerely apologize, and their intentions are genuine, there's no reason to hold a grudge."
"390","R_3sdLMDP1jJvDy90","When the grudge doesn't have long-lasting repercussions, or the reason for the grudge was so long ago it was forgotten, or if it could be resolved by having a mature discussion, or if recompense was made and agreed upon by both parties"

"392","R_1CkgIeMqN6Yycps","If something was done accidentally, I don't think a grudge is warranted. I think intent is something that people need to take into account in these situations. I think if someone hurt someone's feelings but didn't mean it and this isn't a regular occurrence, then it should be forgiven."
"393","R_1JXcwHgKbUMuUVJ","I think it is wrong to hold a grudge against someone when they have mistakenly hurt you, have significantly changed and apologized since hurting you, or there were other factors that played into the reason/cause of them hurting you. An apology is very important in all of these scenarios."
